# guitar-note-trainer

[Try it out here](https://seokky.github.io/guitar-note-trainer/)

The app generates a pair consisting of a string name and a note to find and play it. 

In "chords" mode, a pair is generated from the name of the chord form and the name of the chord to be played.

You can manually switch pairs or let app do it automatically - just manage interval value from 3 to 60 for this case or keep default value. Also you can manually switch pairs while auto mode enabled - it will continue to work correctly.

***P.S.: I made this simple app to help myself with learning of musical notes and chord shapes on guitar. I didn't try to write beautiful canonical code, but just wanted to quickly implement what came to mind. Therefore, you should not judge my skills by the code of this app.***
